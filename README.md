# Siteleaf-web
source code for siteleaf web. Its generated using Jekyll.

# Edit this 
install ruby, rubygems and jekyll etc.

# Run this
For running it locally use `bundle exec jekyll serve`

# Folder structure
- _includes    : this contains include folders
- _layouts     : how pages and posts are rendered
- _posts       : mark down file of all posts
- _site        : This is where jekyll generates the site.
               It should be ignored by git since we are using siteLeaf and github pipeline to build and deploy the site? 
- _uploads     : for some weird reason, this is the upload folder (siteleaf wants this?)
