source code for siteleaf web

folder structure
+- _includes    : this contains include folders
+- _layouts     : how pages and posts are rendered
+- _posts       : mark down file of all posts
+- _site        : This is where jekyll generates the site.
                : It should be ignored by git since we are using siteLeaf and github pipeline to build and deploy the site? 
+- _uploads     : for some weird reason, this is the upload folder (siteleaf wants this?)
